      "release_date": "2022-04-01",
      "review": "Face tat albino to CGI spooky face this is one of the worst superhero films ever made. I just watched Morbius and I know next to nothing about him, what kind of doctor is he again? What does he enjoy? Is there some kind of romance between him & his lady doctor? I cannot tell you and who is Milo? Dr Who's character in this story is \"best friend who is also disabled\" and other than that there is no other characterization. I am stuck thinking \"why?\" Why is this movie?"

      "review": "What this film does achieve, however, is telling a solid new Batman story, one with some pretty compelling twists and a strong point-of-view on who, exactly, the Caped Crusader is. By default, that makes it one of the better Batman movies ever made."
